public class amortized_analysis {
    // it refers to determining the time-average running time for a sequence of operations
    // it is different from average asymptotic analysis, bcz here we do not make any assumption about data values
    // whereas in the asymptotic average analysis we assume an overall average performance
    // PREFERRED? when an algo performs some good and some bad operations
    // i.e. very good in most of the cases... but extremely worse in some of the cases
    // STATIC ARRAYS -> python, js, ruby
    // DYNAMIC ARRAYS -> c, c++ uses vectors, java uses ArrayLists

    // CONDITION: works only when we are pushing/pooping elements from the last

    // we can add 1 cell in case of deficiency of cells
    // but amortized algo states to double the array instead
